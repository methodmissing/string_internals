## WIP look into MRI Ruby's COW and buffer semantics for Strings ##

Boilerplate code for an upcoming blog post.

Tested on ruby-1.8.7-p334 (all 1.8.7 versions should be similar), but also compiles on 1.9.2, although some tests fail, as expected.

See [test/test_string_internals.rb](https://github.com/methodmissing/string_internals/blob/master/test/test_string_internals.rb) for now.
